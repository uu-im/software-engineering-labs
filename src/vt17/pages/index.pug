    li The labs consists of four blocks.
      ul
        li Block 1, 2, and 3, consists of...
          ul
            li A <b>mandatory</b> code hand in.
            li A <b>mandatory</b> written opposition of someone else's code hand in.
            li A <b>mandatory</b> presentation of the other person's code hand in and your opposition at the block seminar.
            li <b>mandatory</b> active participation in the block seminar.
            li Multiple <b>optional</b> exercises that help you approach the final hand in.
            li <b>optional</b> but highly encouraged physical participation in the lab sessions.

    li Failure to complete a mandatory step...
      ul
        li ...(regardless of reason) has to be made up for by a written hand in.
        li ...has to be made up for before the one and only supplementary deadline at the end of the course (hand ins after the last deadline will be dealt with next year).

    li Cheating is...
      ul
        li ...handing in something that you did not create by yourself.
        li ...handing in something you are unable to explain.
        li ...a legal matter and will be handled as such.

    li Group work is...
      ul
        li ...<b>mandatory</b>.
        li ...when 2 (or 3 if total is uneven) people both work on and understand(!) the same code base.
        li ...<b>not</b> dividing up the work between you so that one person writes text, and the other writes code.

    li Lab and seminar work is graded as pass or fail.
    li Deadlines, hand in areas, and groups (chosen by you) are found on Studentportalen.
