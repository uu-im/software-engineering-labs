    h1 Software Engineering &mdash; Labs
    p Spring 2014


  .introduction
    p This document explains the general structure of the laborations and how you should approach them. As you might already know, this course consist of four blocks. Covering different topics. The laborations consequently fit within the same blocks.
    p Each block has one laboration document. Each laboration document, however, contain multiple exercises.
    p Each block has multiple laboration sessions in the schedule. Naturally this is because each laboration document contains more laborations than what is exected of you to finish in one session. This means you need to <strong>plan your time</strong>. When you first encounter a laboration document. Read through the whole thing. Make a note of which exercises are mandatory and which are not. And plan your time accordingly.



  h2 Deliverables
  p Each laboration document specifies its deliverables. To complete a lab you simply have to...
  ol
    li Complete a deliverable
    li Show your work to the laboration assistant and follow up on any comments he/she might give untill you get an OK.
    li Repeat 1-2 until enough (defined below) deliverables have been assesed to pass the block.
    li Follow the handin instructions (defined below) and upload the whole block as a zip-file to Studentportalen

  p For each block you must finish <strong>all mandatory exercises, and at least 1 optional</strong>. If no exercises, within a block, are marked as optional, then they are all mandatory.

  p How to hand in...
  ul
    li Each block have it's own assignment area on <em>Studentportalen</em>.
    li Each block <strong>must</strong> be handed in (uploaded to <em>Studentportalen</em>) as a zip-file (<code>.zip</code> or <code>.rar</code> only!)
    li The handed in zip-file of a block <strong>must</strong> contain a (clearly named) folder for each deliverable you wish to deliver.
  p Code conventions...
  ul
    li All code <strong>must</strong> be properly indented.
    li Sensible naming conventions <strong>must</strong> be practiced.



  h2 Grading
  p Labs will only be graded as <code>pass</code> or <code>fail</code>.
  p Each block needs to be handed in a short time after the end of the block. The <strong>deadline</strong> for each block handin can be found at the corresponding assignment area on <em>Studentportalen</em>. Make sure you are aware of when the deadline is when planning your work.</p>
  p If you fail a lab you can of course re-submit and supplement. The <strong>last date for re-submitting</strong> can be found on <em>Studentportalen</em> under the corresponding assignment area. Generally it should be at the end of the course. But make sure you are aware of the last date for supplementation in case the situation would arise.
  p If you fail a lab, and consequently fail (or ignore) to re-submit, we <strong>will not mark you laboration until the end of the semester</strong>. Which means you will not be able to recieve your grade in a timely manner.



  h2 Group work
  p As long as you are working <strong>in the lab room</strong> it's OK to work in groups of two. It's even preferable to work in pairs if you can, because then you can discuss your solutions with each other. Just make sure you take turns in writing code!
  p If you have completed a block as a pair. Only one of you need to upload your work to <em>Studentportalen</em>. The other one simply uploads a simple text document (<code>.txt</code>) specifying who you've worked with.


  h2 Laboration documents
  p You can find the lab instructions for each block below by following the links. Not all labs are published at once, so if there is no link, the lab is yet not published.</p>
