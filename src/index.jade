    h1 Software Engineering &mdash; Labs


  p This course consists of four blocks. <b>Each block requires a completed lab handin</b>. Each handin consist of several exercises.

  p It is reasonable to assume that handins will not be completed during scheduled lab time, and thus you are encouraged to <b>also work on your own</b>.

  p Each handin should be handed in to Studentportalen, only when it is entirely completed. <b>Do not hand in individual exercises</b>.

  p <b>Follow the handin specification</b> of each handin. Ident all code properly. Exercise reasonable naming conventions.

  p <b>Group work is allowed</b>. Max two persons per group. Collaboration must be carried out on a full handin, <b>not on individual exercises</b>.

  p Handins are only graded as pass/fail.

  p There is only <b>one supplementary deadline</b> at the end of the course. Handins given after this deadline will not be marked until the next time the course is run (i.e. next year).

  p If you didn't write/create the code/text/diagram yourself, then it is cheating. If you can't explain the code/text/diagram you claim to have written/creted, then it is cheating. Cheating is a legal matter. Any case of cheating will be forwarded to the appropriate institution. <b>Do not cheat.</b>

  p When an exercise has tests, always <b>make sure the tests are passing before handing in</b> your solution. Do not hand in partilly completed work.
