Each handin consist of several exercises.</p><p>It is reasonable to assume that handins will not be completed during scheduled lab time, and thus you are encouraged to <b>also work on your own</b>.</p><p>Each handin should be handed in to Studentportalen, only when it is entirely completed. <b>Do not hand in individual exercises</b>.</p><p><b>Follow the handin specification</b> of each handin. Ident all code properly. Exercise reasonable naming conventions.</p><p><b>Group work is allowed</b>. Max two persons per group. Collaboration must be carried out on a full handin, <b>not on individual exercises</b>.</p><p>Handins are only graded as pass/fail. Partial handins are not marked.</p><p>There is only <b>one supplementary deadline</b> at the end of the course. Handins given after this deadline will not be marked until the next time the course is run (i.e. next year).</p><p>If you didn't write/create the code/text/diagram yourself, then it is cheating. If you can't explain the code/text/diagram you claim to have written/creted, then it is cheating. Cheating is a legal matter. Any case of cheating will be forwarded to the appropriate institution. <b>Do not cheat.</b></p><p>When an exercise has tests, always <b>make sure the tests are passing before handing in</b> your solution. Do not hand in partilly completed work.</p><p>You're expected to <b>prepare for each lab</b> before the actual occasion as much as needed. Apart from the lectures and course literature be sure to take a look at the study material and resources archive.</p><hr><ul><li><a href="block1.html">Block 1 &mdash; Fundamentals</a></li><li><a href="block2.html">Block 2 &mdash; Testing, Debugging &amp; Refactoring</a></li><li><a href="block3.html">Block 3 &mdash; UML &amp; Design Patterns</a></li><li><a href="block4.html">Block 4 &mdash; Correctness</a></li></ul><hr><p class="text-lg"><span class="fa fa-archive"> <a href="resources.html">Study material and Resources archive</a></span></p></div><script src="../assets/js/prism.js"></script><script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.min.js"></script><script src="../assets/js/main.js"></script></body>
