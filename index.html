<h1>Software Engineering &mdash; Lab instructions</h1>
<p>Spring 2014</p>

<hr>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This document explains the general structure of the laborations and how you should approach them. As you might already know, this course consist of four blocks. Covering different topics. The laborations consequently fit within the same blocks.</p>
<p>Each block has one laboration document. Each laboration document, however, contain multiple more or less related exercises. Each block has multiple laboration sessions in the schedule. Naturally this is because each laboration document contains more laborations than what is exected of you to finish in one session.</p>
<p>This means you need to plan your time. When you first encounter a laboration document. Read through the whole thing. Make mental notes on which exercises that are mandatory and which are not. And plan your time accordingly.</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>
<div style="text-decoration:line-through">
  <p>The laborations will play a 10% role in your overall grade for this course. You can pass or not pass the laborations. Both each laboration, as well as the laborations as a whole.</p>
  <p>Each passed laboration translates into a number of points. You need to achieve a total number of points in order to be able to get a pass for the laborations. However, this means that you can choose to skip some laborations and focus on the ones you really want to complete.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In total there&rsquo;s 100 lab points.</li>
    <li>Each lab block has 25 points.</li>
    <li>To get a pass for all labs, you need a total of 75 points.</li>
  </ul>
